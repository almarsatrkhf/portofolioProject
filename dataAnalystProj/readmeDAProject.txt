Hello!

I am Almarsa Iman Terakahfi, a Geophysical Engineering graduate. 
Recently, I am very interested in building my career in data.

This contains my personal exercise of data analyst themed sql querying, python coding, 
tableau dashboard (CovidDashboard1 and analystPorto.twbx), excel exercise (MSPTDA folder)

The SQLQuery3.sql and SQLcleaning_query.sql raw data and output can be viewed inside the datasets folder
(covidDeathsAlex and covidVaccinationsAlex for SQLQuery3) and (nashville for SQLcleaning_query)
