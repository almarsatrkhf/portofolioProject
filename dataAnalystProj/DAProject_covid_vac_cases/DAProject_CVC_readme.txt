Hello!

I am Almarsa Iman Terakahfi, a Geophysical Engineering graduate. 
Recently, I am very interested in building my career in data.

This folder is my personal exercisee project pulling data from raw excel (covidDeathsAlex.xlsx and CovidVaccinationsAlex.xlsx)
using Microsoft's SQLserver and making a dashboard about vaccinations effect to covid daily cases in indonesia (covidVacVSDailyCases.xlsx).

As we can see, vaccination have huge impact in dampening covid new cases overtime, with a couple spikes caused by covid new variant
(delta and omnicron) at the end of qtr 2 until qtr 3 of 2021 and on the qtr 1 of 2022. At the start of qtr 3 until the end of 2021,
there's a rapid climb of the number of people fully vaccinnated which result at the low numbers of daily new cases at the time.
